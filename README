OpenGL utility functions for Go

This package provides utility functions for tighter integration
with Go than a more conservative wrapping might provide. It is
intended to be used in conjunction with such a wrapper.
Currently, it depends lightly on github.com/banthar/gl

Utility function list:

TexImage2DFromImage
 - load texture image from image.Image

TexSubImage2DFromImage (*)
 - load texture subimage from image.Image

CompressedTexImage2DFromImage
 - load texture image from image.Image
 - only accepts Dxt1,Dxt3,Dxt5 (from glimage pkg)
 - see github.com/spate/glimage/dds for a DDS loader

(*) indicates untested
